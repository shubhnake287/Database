				    Constraining the Values of your data

1)1) Create the Orders table so that all onum values as well as all combinations of
cnum and snum are different from one another, and so that NULL values are
excluded from the date field.
->create table orders1(
    onum int(4),
    atm float(7,2),
    odate date not null,
    snum int(4),
    cnum int(4),
    primary key(onum,snum,cnum)
);

2) Create the Salespeople table so that the default commission is 10% with no
NULLS permitted, snum is the primary key, and all names fall alphabetically
between A and M, inclusive (assume all names will be uppercase).

create  table Salespeople1
(
snum int(4) primary key,
sname varchar(20) check((substr(sname,1,1)) between 'A' and 'M'),	
city varchar(10),
comm int(3) default 10 not null
);


3) Create the Orders table, making sure that the onum is greater than the cnum, and
the cnum is greater that the snum. Allow no NULLS in any of these three fields.
Ans->

create  table Salespeople2
(
onum int(4) not null,
cnum int(4) not null,
snum int(4) not null,
check(onum > cum and cnum >snum)
);
