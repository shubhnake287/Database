ASSIGNMENT NO. 20 :-

1) Which of these views are updateable (will allow DML operations)?    

#1  Create View Dailyorders    
  as Select Distinct cnum, snum, onum, odate from Orders;  
-> This will allow to create updatable view.

#2  Create View Custotals    
  as Select cname, Sum (amt) Sum_Amt from Orders, Customers   where Orders.cnum=Customers.cnum  Group by cname;  
-> this view is not allow to create updatable view because if you use aggregate function,group by,join then you cannot create an updatable view

#3  Create view Thirdorders    
  as Select * from Dailyorders  where odate=’1990-10-03’;  
-> this view will allowed to create updatable view

#4  Create view Nullcities     
  as Select snum, sname, city  from Salespeople  where city is NULL   OR sname BETWEEN ‘A’ and ‘MZ’;  
-> this view will allowed to create updatable view
  
2) Create a view of the Salespeople table called Commissions. This view will include only the snum and comm fields. Through this view, someone could enter or change commissions, 
  but only to values between .10 and .20.  
-> CREATE VIEW commissions as SELECT snum,comm FROM salespeople WHERE comm between 0.10 and 0.20 ;

3) Some SQL implementations have a built-in constant representing the current date, sometimes called “CURDATE” or “SYSDATE”.  The word SYSDATE can therefore be used in a SQL statement, 
   and be replaced by the current date when the value is accessed by commands such as Select or Insert. We will use a view of the Orders table called Entryorders to insert rows into 
   the Orders table. Create the Orders table, so that SYSDATE is automatically inserted for odate if no value is given. Then create the Entryorders view so that no values can be given. 
-> CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `ORDERS_NEW`(
   Onum INT(4),
   Amt FLOAT(7,2),
   Odate DATE default CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
   Cnum INT(4),
   Snum INT(4)
   );

  create view Entryorders as 
  select * from ORDERS_NEW;
