			  Creating Tables and Indexes
1) Write a command that will enable a user to pull orders grouped by date out of the
Orders table quickly.
Ans->
create index i_odate on orders(odate);

select onum,odate from orders
group by odate;

2) If the Orders table has already been created, how can you force the onum field to
be unique (assume all current values are unique)?
Ans-> alter table orders 
 		add primary key (onum);

3) Create an index that would permit each salesperson to retrieve his or her orders
grouped by date quickly.
Ans->create index i_sname_odate on orders(Snum, Odate);

4) Let us assume that each salesperson is to have only one customer of a given
rating, and that this is currently the case. Enter a command that enforces it.

Ans-> ALTER TABLE customers MODIFY rating int PRIMARY KEY;
