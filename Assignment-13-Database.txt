					     Using the UNION clause

1) Create a union of two queries that shows the names, cities, and ratings of all customers.
 Those with rating of 200 or greater will also have the words “High Rating”, while the others will
 have the words “Low Rating”.
Ans-

select cname,city,if (rating < 200,'LOW Rating','High Rating') Rating_name from customers
union
select cname,city,if (rating >=200,'HIGH Rating','LOW Rating')Rting_name from customers ;


2) Write a command that produces the name and number of each salesperson and each customer 
with more than one current order. Put the results in alphabetical order. 

Ans->
select sname,snum from salespeople 
where snum IN
(select snum from orders  group by snum having count(*) > 1)
union
select cname,cnum from customers 
where snum IN
(select snum from orders  group by snum having count(*) > 1);



 
3) Form a union of three queries. Have the first select the snums of all salespeople
in San Jose; the second, the cnums of all customers in San Jose; and the third the onums
of all orders on October 3. Retain duplicates between the last two queries but eliminate 
any redundancies between either of them and the first.   (Note: in the sample tables as given, 
there would be no such redundancy. This is besides the point.

Ans->
select snum from salespeople where city = 'san jose'
union 
select cnum from customers where city = 'san jose'
union
select onum from orders where odate='1990-10-03';

Or
select snum from salespeople
where city ='san jose'
union
select distinct snum from orders 
where snum IN 
(select snum from orders 
where odate ='1990-10-03');
